// It is a good practice to keep the API protos messages (wire) separate from the internal server proto messages (storage). 
// This separation of wire from storage proto message allows flexibility to modify one without the other. In the long run
// this separation pays off for the extra effort of translating between the wire and storage protos.

// Book resource. Internal to the server.
message Book {
    // Book id.
    string id = 1;

    // Title.
    string title = 2;
